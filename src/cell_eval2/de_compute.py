    This is gpudge's `filter_gene_min_cpm_cell` gate quantity in EVERY normalization mode, which
    is what makes it the one definition cell_eval2 can hold on to:

      * gpudge normalizing to a target `T` -- it compares `arith_ref * 1e6/T`, and every cell was
        scaled to `T`, so `mean_i(x_norm) * 1e6/T == mean_i(x_raw/L_i * 1e6)`;
      * gpudge not normalizing -- it builds a separate per-cell-CPM accumulator for the gate
        (`_need_scaled_extra` -> `other_ref_acc`), which is this quantity directly.

    ⚠️ INVARIANT under any per-cell rescaling of `X`, because `x_ig/L_i` is. So it does not matter
    whether `X` holds raw counts, CPM, a `target_sum`-normalized matrix, or expm1'd lognorm values
    -- all four give the same vector. That is the property the caller needs: cell_eval2 holds a
    different one of those four on each gpudge sub-path.

    ⚠️ "Invariant" is the exact statement for the ARITHMETIC: `x_ig/L_i` is unchanged by any
    POSITIVE per-cell rescaling. The floating results of two such matrices can still differ in the
    last bits, which is why the frame route -- bit-exact against gpudge's own accumulator -- is kept
    for the competition rather than replaced by this.

    Computed as `w @ X` with `w_i = 1e6/(n * L_i)` rather than by materialising a rescaled copy: the
    reference pool is ~18k cells x ~18k genes on the official panels, so a float64 copy would be a
    ~2.7 GB transient for a vector. SPARSE input costs at most one O(nnz) copy of `.data` (none when
    it is already float64), never the matrix; DENSE input is walked in bounded CELL chunks, because
    `np.asarray(X, dtype=float)` on a float32 panel is exactly the whole-matrix transient this
    avoids. Row sums accumulate in float64 on both branches -- summing ~18k float32 values in

    """`(threshold, cpm_factor, ref_cpm, keep_gpudge_gate)` for the reference-only CPM gate (#351).

    cell_eval2 owns this gate even on the gpudge path, because gpudge's own
    `filter_gene_min_cpm_cell` keeps a (target, gene) cell when the TARGET group's mean CPM clears
    the threshold OR the reference's does (`gpudge._filter.combined_keep_mask`: "AND each active
    filter's (target OR ref) mask"). That OR is the #351 leak, and it is upstream of
    `_apply_cpm_filter` -- `compute_de` returns from its gpudge branch before the CPU gate runs --
    so the CPU clause alone would move no gpudge number.

    TWO ROUTES, and which one is taken decides whether gpudge's own gate may stay on:

    * `ref_cpm is None` (the FRAME route): `ref_mean * cpm_factor` is the per-cell-CPM mean the gate
      wants, and it is gpudge's OWN accumulator rather than merely equal to it. That needs
      `mean_calc='arithmetic'` (else `ref_mean` is the GEOMETRIC control mean -- gpudge does emit
      that, but its gate compares an ARITHMETIC reference mean it accumulates separately and does
      NOT return, so the emitted column is the wrong statistic) AND `gpudge_normalized` -- gpudge
      itself scaled every cell
      to a known finite `target_sum`, so its gate computes `arith_ref * 1e6/T` from the very array
      it returns. The competition takes this route with `cpm_factor` exactly 1.0.
      ⚠️ NOT enough that SOME normalization gave the cells a uniform library. When `_to_linear`
      pre-normalized counts on the CPU, `ref_mean * 1e6/T` is only ALGEBRAICALLY equal to the
      per-cell CPM: gpudge downcasts the staged values to float32, so the staged row totals need
      not be `T` bit-for-bit, and its gate reads a separate per-cell accumulator anyway. Those go
      to the matrix route, which compares the quantity this docstring names.
    * otherwise (the MATRIX route): `ref_cpm` comes from `_ref_cpm_from_cells` on the reference
      cells, which is normalization-invariant and therefore right on every remaining sub-path --
      lognorm, CPU-pre-normalized counts, an unknown library (gpudge's internal median), and a
      geometric `mean_calc` alike.

    `keep_gpudge_gate` is the fourth return, and the caller MUST pass
    `filter_gene_min_cpm_cell=None` to gpudge when it is False. It is True only on the FRAME route
    AND when GPUDGE ITSELF normalized to the finite target: only then does gpudge's gate literally
    compute `arith_ref * 1e6/T` from the array it returns, which is what makes the nesting exact
    (`ref > t` implies `tmean > t or ref > t`, so its pre-filter removes nothing this gate would
    keep) while letting it keep its gene-chunk pruning. In every other case gpudge compares a
    quantity that agrees with this one mathematically but not bit-for-bit -- a separate
    per-cell-CPM accumulator when cell_eval2 pre-normalized, an arithmetic mean when this gate is
    reading a geometric frame -- so a gene within float noise of the threshold could be dropped by
    its OR for one target and kept here for another. That is a target-DEPENDENT surviving set, the
    one thing #351 exists to rule out, so gpudge's gate is muted rather than trusted.

    `ref_cells` is None when the reference matrix is not in hand (`compute_de_streaming`: the
    reference shard lives inside the archive), and then the matrix route is unavailable -- an
    active gate that cannot take the frame route RAISES there rather than gate on the wrong
    quantity. No shipped preset reaches it: `v1` is the only one with `target_sum=None` or a
    geometric `mean_calc` and it sets `filter_gene_min_cpm_cell=None`, so its gate is inert.

    stops describing the table it sits in. gpudge says the same of its own output ("p_adj values

    NaN p_values (degenerate/constant genes from wilcoxon) are held out of the BH set and mapped

    would crash the (v2-default) filter path (Gemini re-review).

    LFC computation via `arith_means` when the LFC also used the arithmetic mean, else computed
    here from `linear`. `linear` is normalized to the LFC target_sum, so the means are scaled to
    TRUE CPM (per 1e6) by `cpm_factor` (=1e6/target_sum) before the threshold compare, keeping the
    kept-gene set target_sum-independent (F4.1).

    ⚠️ The REFERENCE group ALONE decides the kept set (#351), so it is one property of the data,
    identical for every target. It used to be `target-group OR reference-group`, and that OR made a
    row's mere PRESENCE a disclosure of its log2FC's sign: for a gene at or below the threshold in
    the control, the row (t, g) existed only when g rose above the threshold in t, so
    `tmean > threshold >= ref_mean`, hence `(tmean+eps)/(ref_mean+eps) > 1` and log2FC > 0.
    (NOT `log2FC > log2(threshold/ref_mean)`, which #351 states and which the pseudocount breaks:
    `(threshold+eps)/(ref_mean+eps) <= threshold/ref_mean` for `ref_mean <= threshold`, and the
    right-hand side is undefined at `ref_mean = 0`. Strict positivity is the claim that matters and
    the one the measurement confirms.) Measured on the
    three official val panels: P(real log2FC > 0) = 1.000000 over 26,373 / 33,969 / 26,839 such
    rows, and a submission that pasted control cells with counts added to exactly those genes --
    reading no perturbation-specific information at all -- took +0.3722 / +0.5059 / +0.3651 of
    `de_wilcoxon_direction_fidelity_yield_raw`'s `from_baseline` and +0.1057 of OVERALL `avg_score`.
    Under the reference-only gate those arms return to the honest control-paste floor. The cost is
    real and is not hidden: the 0.88%-1.16% of reference rows only a perturbed group detected are
    genuine up-regulations, and they leave the scoreable set.

    ⚠️ The per-target BH recomputation below is LOAD-BEARING for that, not bookkeeping. Dropping
    rows shrinks each target's multiple-testing universe, and it is applied to EACH SIDE's own
    table, so the prediction's `p_adj` is re-adjusted too: removing an attack's boosted block
    (p ~ 1e-20) collapses BH's step-up and its remaining marginal calls stop being significant as
    well. That is why the arm's `n_pred` goes to 0 rather than to ~4."""
