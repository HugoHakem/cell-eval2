"""Per-group second moments and the primitives built on them.

The sufficient statistic for the sampling-bias correction in issue #198 is one fp64 scalar
per group, ``sumsq[p] = Σᵢ ‖xᵢ‖²``, alongside the per-group cell count every pseudobulk
driver already accumulates. From those two::

    tr Σ̂_p = ( sumsq[p] − counts[p]·‖means[p]‖² ) / ( counts[p] − 1 )

Only the TRACE is ever needed, never the covariance matrix, so memory is O(P), not O(P·G).

⚠️ THAT IS THE ``lognorm`` HALF. Issue #264's ``bulk_lognorm`` comparator is a function of
the group SUM, whose sampling variance no single-pass sufficient statistic can express, so
it carries a **second** per-group scalar — ``jk``, the delete-1 jackknife of
:func:`jackknife_correction`, which costs a dense second pass. On that path ``sumsq``/
``counts`` are still accumulated but stay in **raw counts** space rather than the
comparator's, so they are NOT interchangeable with the bulk means and ``tr Σ̂`` over them is
not a correction for anything. :func:`correction_for` is the only supported way to ask for
"the correction": it dispatches on the comparator and refuses each artifact in the other's
slot rather than falling back. The artifact stays O(P) either way.

This module lives at the top level rather than under ``metrics/`` because ``prep``,
``streaming_bulk``, ``gpu.bulk`` and ``cache`` all need :class:`GroupMoments` and none of
them may import from ``metrics/``.

    ``r_i == 0`` means cell i holds every count in the group; the leave-one-out remainder is
    all zero, and the existing all-zero-bulk contract (``prep.bulk_lognorm_means``) maps that
    to a zero bulk rather than a NaN. Negative ``r_i`` is impossible for counts and is a
    corrupt input, not a case to smooth over. Note the masking happens BEFORE the shift, so an
    ``r_i == 0`` row contributes ``0 - b_g``: its ``v`` really is zero, and the variance is
    taken over the actual values.

    WARNING -- returns the DEVIATION, not ``v`` itself, and that is load-bearing. Every caller
    feeds this straight into a variance, and variance is invariant under ``v -> v - b``, so the

    SUMMED OVER GENES, interchangeable with ``trace_over_n_for``'s return.

    ``O(n·G)`` DENSE, not ``O(nnz)``: dropping cell ``i`` moves ``S_p``, so a gene where that
    cell has no counts still changes. Cells are visited in ``chunk``-row blocks, so the working
    set scales as ``chunk × G`` -- but the CONSTANT is not 1. :func:`_loo_bulk` holds several
    ``chunk × G`` fp64 temporaries live at once (the dense block, the numerator, the ``log1p``,
    the masked ``where``, the shift), and MEASURED at 500 cells × 18,533 genes, ~20k UMI/cell,
    the peak Python allocation is **349 MiB at the default ``chunk=512``** against a naive
    ``chunk × G × 8B`` of 72 MiB -- **4.8×**. Budget from the measured figure, not the bound.

    That peak is the knob to turn if memory is tight, and it is free to turn: the shifted
    reduction is chunk-invariant to ~1 ULP (see below), so the block size is a cost knob and
    not an answer knob. Measured on that same group -- 349 MiB / 375 ms at ``chunk=512``, 157 MiB / 161 ms
    at 128, **89 MiB / 116 ms at 32**. Smaller blocks are both smaller and faster here because
    one temporary at ``chunk=32`` is 4.7 MB and stays in cache while ``chunk=512``'s is 76 MB
    and does not. The default is left at 512 pending a measurement on a second box.

    Two different benchmarks, so do not read them as one run: spec §4.1 measured **~222 ms per
    group / ~67 s per 300-construct archive** on the real panel, and the memory figures above
    come from a synthetic panel of the same shape on a different host (which timed the same
    default block at 375 ms). Either way the correction roughly doubles an expression-only
    scoring run and is negligible next to DE.

    ``n < 2`` returns 0.0, mirroring ``trace_over_n_for``'s policy of subtracting nothing
    rather than returning NaN. The reduction is ``s2 - s1²/n`` over :func:`_loo_bulk`'s
    return, which is ALREADY the deviation from the full-sample bulk -- see its docstring for
    why that shift is exact and why it lives there rather than at each kernel. Shifted, this
    lands at machine epsilon and is chunk-invariant to **~1 ULP** -- MEASURED bit-identical
    across ``chunk`` 7…1024 at (n=500, G=113) and (n=300, G=997), and 2.6e-16 relative at
    (n=400, G=251), which is three orders inside the ``rtol=1e-13`` that
    ``test_the_chunk_size_does_not_change_the_answer`` asserts. Block summation reassociates,
    so exact equality is a common outcome and not a guarantee; the UNSHIFTED form was 5.551e-11
    off at n=40 and 1.539e-06 at n=4000, which is what that test exists to catch. The result is
    still clamped at zero because a correction is a variance and a negative one would be
    subtracted as a bonus.

    ⚠️ **``C`` IS BIASED UPWARD, and how much depends on ``bulk_target_sum`` (issue #268).**
    The delete-1 jackknife carries the usual Efron-Stein upward bias, and ``TS`` sets where
    ``log1p``'s linear→log knee sits relative to expression: the larger ``TS`` is against the
    panel's own depth, the more near-empty genes are treated as log-fold-changes, and those are
    exactly where the bias lives. MEASURED on a 6-line, 400-cell/construct, ~20k-UMI,
    18,533-gene panel by the split-half identity ``E‖b_A − b_B‖² = C_A + C_B`` (uncapped -- the
    #247 ``min`` hides two thirds of it, reading +0.75% where the uncapped form reads +2.06%):

        TS      2e3    5e3    1e4    2e4    5e4    1e5    3e5    1e6

    Those readouts include a +0.25% inflation from the halves being complementary subsets of
    one group, so subtract it for the estimator's own bias.

    **The shipped default is ``TS = 5e4`` (#268, 2026-08-11).** It reads 0.32% here, i.e.
    ~0.07% once the +0.25% artifact is removed, which meets spec §2's "``C`` right to ~0.1%".
    ``TS = 1e6`` was the shipped value until then and is **the one value on this sweep where
    the metric breaks**: 2.06% (~1.81% net), the split-half ceiling negative on 6 of 6 lines,
    and the "predict the control" anchor at 1.073 where it must read 1.0 -- against a
    ``scales.py`` base that ships as a hard 1.0. Only ~25% of the denominator survives its own
    correction there, which amplifies every error ~4x. 1e6 did not win on the axis spec §3.2
    chose it for either: effective gene count peaks at 3e5 and is lower at 1e6 (8,485) than at
    1e5 (8,856).

def trace_over_n_for(moments: GroupMoments, perts, means: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """``tr Σ̂_p / n_p`` for each label in ``perts``, looked up in ``moments`` by label.

    ``moments`` may span MORE groups than ``perts`` -- it always carries the control and is
    never restricted -- but every label in ``perts`` must be present in it. A missing label
    means some driver restricted the moments, which is the invariant this raises on.

    **``counts < 2`` yields 0.0, not NaN (issue #219).** ``trace_sigma`` is right to call the
    covariance UNDEFINED there; this function returns the CORRECTION TO SUBTRACT, and when
    there is no estimate available it deliberately subtracts ZERO. That is a fallback, not the
    estimator's answer: the true expected term at n=1 is ``tr Σ``, so subtracting nothing
    leaves this SUMMED primitive upward-biased by ``tr Σ`` and the metric, which carries the
    ``1/G``, upward-biased by ``tr Σ / G``. The distinction is the whole fix, which is why the
    policy lives here and the primitive stays honest.

    **Everything OTHER than ``n >= 1`` now RAISES (issue #227).** ``counts == 0`` is not the
    #219 case and never was: a group with no cells has no sample mean either, so its bulk row
    is meaningless and a zero correction would be a fallback for a state that cannot occur
    rather than a modelled quantity. Negative, fractional and non-finite counts are not states
    that can occur at all -- each one means the moments disagree with the pseudobulk they were
    produced with. Until #227 all four took the ``counts < 2`` branch alongside ``n == 1`` and
    became a plausible finite number, silently; they are now rejected in the same spirit as the
    missing-label check a few lines above, which already treats a moments/pseudobulk mismatch as
    an invariant violation rather than something to paper over.

    None of them arises from ``prep.pseudobulk_with_moments`` (groups come from observed labels,
    so ``counts = np.diff(bounds) >= 1``); they arrive from a corrupt cache, a malformed stream,
    or a directly constructed :class:`GroupMoments`. ``trace_sigma``'s NaN-at-``n < 2`` contract
    is UNCHANGED -- it is right to call the covariance undefined, and the validation lives here
    for the same reason the ``n < 2`` policy does: the primitive stays honest and the consumer
    decides what it is allowed to accept.

    ⚠️ EVERY NUMBER IN THE REST OF THIS DOCSTRING IS PRE-#247, in squared-expression
    units and measured before the cap. That metric is restored as ``expr_mse_unbiased``.
    The behaviour these numbers justify -- subtract zero rather than NaN at ``n < 2`` -- is
    unchanged and still right, and the magnitudes once more describe that restored metric.

    Returning NaN made the perturbation vanish: ``expr_mse_unbiased`` carries
    ``worst_value=None``, so ``run.py``'s no-drop fill skips it and ``aggregate_metrics``
    drops NaN before the mean. Since ``n_pred`` is chosen by the SUBMITTER -- predicted group
    sizes need not match the reference, only the perturbation set does -- a submission could
    emit a single cell for exactly the perturbations it predicted worst and have them leave
    its own aggregate. Measured on the old behaviour: thinning one badly-predicted group to
    one cell moved the aggregate 0.49733 -> 0.00012, a ~4000x improvement for DEGRADING the
    submission, while ``expr_mse`` correctly worsened 0.50060 -> 0.75930.

    Subtracting zero instead makes that a PENALTY IN EXPECTATION rather than a reward, and a
    self-calibrating one: with a single cell the estimator keeps the full sampling inflation
    ``E‖x̄ − μ‖² = tr Σ / n = tr Σ`` instead of removing it. Measured at ``SD = 0.7``,
    ``G = 2000``: the honest n=300 mean METRIC VALUE is 0.9978 and the thinned n=1 value is
    1.4863 -- a +0.488 expected penalty against a predicted ``SD² = 0.490``. (Values, not
    scores; ``clamp_high=1.0`` makes a score of 1.4863 impossible.) No invented constant, and
    no policy call about whether thin groups are legitimate: they are, they just cannot claim a
    correction they did not earn. A lucky single draw can still land near the reference -- the
    penalty holds on average, not per realization.

    SCOPE -- this closes the ``n < 2`` door, not the metric. The estimator stays UNBIASED for
    every ``n >= 2`` (its mean is flat at 0.996-0.998 from n=2 to n=300), so nothing
    bias-based replaces the dropped-perturbation route at that door. It does NOT make
    ``expr_mse_unbiased`` robust in general: ``tr Σ̂_pred/n_pred`` is still computed from the
    cells the submission emits, so reporting the same predicted mean through a more dispersed
    set of cells lowers the metric for free. That channel is separate from this one, and it is
    BOUNDED under input validation -- ``validate_input_type`` requires non-negative values (and
    ``EvalConfig.validate_input=False`` skips it, in which case the bound does not hold).
    NON-NEGATIVITY ALONE caps the per-gene correction at m² for every n >= 2 at a fixed
    per-gene mean m; at n < 2 it is the zero fallback above, not m². Putting all mass on one
    cell attains that ceiling, though that construction must still clear the rest of
    validation (``check_scale_limit`` may reject it); the ceiling holds either way. This
    function
    returns the SUMMED quantity, so the bound here is ``G*mean(m²)``; dividing by G puts it at
    ``mean(m²)``, which is the restored metric's scale. ``metrics.delta.mse_unbiased`` applies
    that 1/G at the call site once more. Measured at a fixed predicted mean (G=2000,
    gamma panel, mean(m²)=0.4593): the correction goes 0.0015 -> 0.4593 and u only 24.9985 ->
    24.5407, where an unvalidated 2 cells at ±100 would give -9975. Generally
    ``u >= expr_mse - mean(m²) - C_real`` -- a LOWER BOUND, not an equality, since attaining it
    also needs the extremizer to clear ``check_scale_limit``. A large error is safe only
    RELATIVE to ``mean(m²)``. See ``docs/metrics.md`` §2.3.

    ⚠️ **That paragraph describes the world before issue #247, and this primitive is still that
    world.** The dispersion channel is now bounded at the CALL SITE, not here:
    ``metrics.delta.mse_unbiased_capped`` caps the prediction's term at
    ``PRED_TRACE_CAP_K * tr Σ̂_real/n_real`` (k=1), so the reachable subtraction is
    ``2 * C_real`` rather than ``mean(m²)``. The policy lives there for the same reason the
    ``n < 2`` policy lives in *this* function rather than in ``trace_sigma``: the primitive
    returns the honest quantity and the metric decides what it is allowed to claim. Anything
    calling ``trace_over_n_for`` directly gets the UNCAPPED term and inherits the old bound.
    Unbiasedness still assumes an honest iid emission; cell_eval2 does not verify it, and no
    longer relies on it for this channel.

    A weak lottery also remains at small n, since the VARIANCE grows as n shrinks --
    best-of-400 draws improves 0.9929 at n=300 to 0.9216 at n=2, ~7% -- and it costs 400
    resamples against a reference the submitter cannot see. A minimum-n gate on the REAL side
    (the ``de_lfc_nmae`` pattern) would NOT close it: it keeps omission submission-independent
    but leaves ``n_pred``, which drives the lottery, unconstrained.
