"""Generic-response baseline: one average perturbation response, emitted for every
perturbation, scored as an ordinary submission.

A raw metric value is uninterpretable without a comparator. This module builds the
predictor that supplies one -- a model handed the average perturbation response and
nothing target-specific. It is an ORACLE comparator, not a floor a submission could
reach: the profile is averaged from the evaluated real perturbations, so it is
transductive and no real submission has access to that data. What it bounds is a
metric's TRIVIALITY -- a score at or below it is not evidence of target-specific skill.
Designs of record:
``internal:docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-29-generic-response-baseline-design.md`` for the profile
and ``internal:docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-05-baseline-dispersed-emission-design.md`` for its
emission as cells.

    ``emit="dispersed"`` is COUNTS-ONLY. With a lognorm-effective template, scaling
    log-space values by a ratio of log-space means is not a fold change, and no later
    per-cell CPM normalization repairs it. This is a DOCUMENTED PRECONDITION, not an
    enforced one: the guard lives in ``build_generic_baseline``, because effective input
    type is a function of ``EvalConfig`` and this constructor receives no config.

    In counts space, conditional on the fixed control pool, the construction has
    ``E[group counts mean] = r * ctrl = profile`` exactly on every reachable gene before
    float32 rounding. It does NOT imply that the group's lognorm mean equals the lognorm
    profile; the measured cost is +2.8% (0.012568 versus 0.012226 for the profile compared
    directly without cells) -- ⚠️ **all three figures are pre-#247 ``expr_mse_unbiased``**, in
    squared expression units. The RATIO does not transfer either: normalization happens per
    perturbation and then aggregates, and ``mean(N_a/D_p) / mean(N_b/D_p)`` is not
    ``mean(N_a)/mean(N_b)``. Only the QUALITATIVE claim survives -- emitting through cells
    costs something, and it is small. Re-measure before quoting a number against an
    ``expr_mse_unbiased_capped`` column. Calibrating ``r`` against the
    post-normalization target was considered and rejected: it fits the comparator to the
    metric and breaks the counts-space semantics used by this module. The emission is not
    unexecutable by a submission: normalization is public and the control pool was handed
    out. The profile itself remains oracle information.

    Scaling is multiplicative because counts must remain non-negative. An additive shift
    needs clipping, which biases the mean it was meant to hit. With-replacement draws are
    iid from the empirical transformed-control distribution conditional on the pool. Thus
    ``tr(Sigma-hat_pred) / n_pred`` is the right ``expr_mse_unbiased_capped`` correction:
    duplicates are legal and no finite-population correction is needed. Drawing without
    replacement would require one and the metric would over-subtract.

    A direct caller who supplies its own ``cache_pred`` can collide across emission modes
    and seeds: non-strict ``fingerprint_adata`` never reads ``X``.

    Both arms retain the template contract: same shape, whole ``obs`` including its index,
    same ``var``, and control rows copied from the template and cast to float32.

    This arm is known-biased. Per-cell normalization followed by averaging is not the
    normalization of a tiled mean: the measured +0.464 mean-per-gene gap is 96% of tile's
    ``expr_mse`` (0.3936 versus 0.0126 for dispersed). Identical predicted cells also
    force the pred-side covariance to zero, yielding 9,701 significant genes per
    perturbation versus 414 for dispersed and 2,739 in the reference. Use
    ``build_baseline_prediction(..., emit="dispersed")`` for the supported construction;
    tile exists only to reproduce pre-fix numbers.

    Same perturbations, same cells per perturbation, same ``var``, same ``obs`` -- because
    cell counts drive the DE p-values, so a baseline with fabricated counts would be a
    comparator for a different experiment. The WHOLE ``obs`` is copied, not just
    ``pert_col``: the deseq2 backend requires ``de.replicate_col`` in the prediction's obs
    (``deseq2_de.py:26-32``), and the real-control concat retains only columns common to
    both sides, so a pert_col-only copy would drop it and DE would fail.

    The CONTROL rows carry ``template``'s own control cells, NOT the profile. Filling them
    with the profile makes the prediction's control equally constant, so under
    ``control_source="pred"`` the predicted delta is identically zero and the DE is fully
    tied (measured: direction_precision 0.0, delta_pearson -1.0). With the real control's
    cells the two ``control_source`` settings agree, which is what lets the baseline stay
    convention-neutral -- no forced override, no v1-vs-v2 wrinkle. It is also the honest
    predictor: the generic-response hypothesis is about PERTURBATION responses and says
    nothing about the control.

    ``X`` remains the old materialized dense float32 ``np.tile`` array, deliberately not
    ``np.broadcast_to``. This exact representation is retained only to reproduce #225's
    reference points and the pre-fix campaign; dispersed emission mirrors template
    sparsity and avoids this dense construction intermediate for sparse references.

    float32 is also why the control rows are ``template.X`` CAST, not ``template.X``: on a
    float64 reference the two ``control_source`` settings then agree to float32 round-off
    (measured: DE metrics exactly, delta_pearson to 6.5e-9) rather than bit-for-bit.
    Promoting to the template's dtype would buy that exactness by doubling the largest

    The reference may be integer counts while a mean-scaled emission is fractional, so the
    prediction can detect as ``lognorm`` against a ``counts`` reference and every expression
    metric would silently compare two different spaces. ``allow_fractional_counts`` does

    This CHECKS the invariant rather than inferring it, because ``guess_is_lognorm`` tests
    fractional ROW TOTALS, not fractional entries: a fractional profile whose row total is
    an integer resolves to ``counts``, and it can do so against a ``lognorm`` reference --
    the same corruption in the opposite direction, which an inferred rule would leave in

    mismatch that ``score_metrics``'s column check cannot see.

    The column check catches a v1-vs-v2 mix (the versions emit different metric names). It
    cannot see a convention mismatch behind identical names -- a baseline built at
    ``de.p_adj_threshold=0.01`` scored against submissions at 0.05 yields
    identically-shaped frames and silently wrong margins. That is what this is for.

    CALL IT ON THE REQUESTED CONFIG, never the effective one. The baseline's deliberate
    deviations (allow_fractional_counts, allow_discrete, cache_pred) must not reach the
    digest, or every baseline mismatches every ordinary run by construction; but exempting
    the value-affecting ones is unsound in the other direction, since a baseline requested
    with allow_discrete=False and a user run requested with True would then digest
    identically while interpreting matrices in different spaces. Digesting what was ASKED
    FOR resolves both.

    ``metrics`` is normalized to its RESOLVED canonical list so a run using the profile
    name and a run using the equivalent explicit list agree -- otherwise the mismatch
    check would fire on two runs that are in fact identical. For the same reason the
    MACHINE-RESOLVABLE spellings are canonicalized to what they resolve to, exactly as
    ``run._result_config_digest`` does for the result-cache key (``run.py:660-676``):
    ``device="auto"`` and an explicit ``device="cpu"`` on one host produce identical
    numbers and must not mismatch, while two hosts that genuinely resolve differently
    still must. The DE backend is resolved only when a DE metric is actually requested
    with at least one side computed -- resolving it otherwise would make a minimal install
    raise for nothing (``run.py:663-670``).

    ``metric_agg`` records each resolved metric's AGGREGATION STATISTIC alongside its name
    (#231). Names alone cannot see a change of statistic: the 18 direction entries that moved
    from ``median`` to ``mean`` in v0.8.0 kept their names and their ``full``/``de``
    membership, so a v0.7 baseline and a v0.8 run would digest identically while their
    whole-cohort numbers answer different questions -- and the margins ``score_metrics``
    computes from them would be silently wrong. This is what makes an aggregation change a
    LOUD failure (``cli.py`` raises unless ``--allow-config-mismatch``) rather than a quiet
    one. The runtime version stamp is not a substitute: ``cell_eval2_version`` resolves
    through the INSTALLED distribution metadata, which in a dev tree need not be the tree
    under test.

    ⚠️ **KNOWN GAP -- no metric-SEMANTICS term (#314).** Everything above digests what the run
    ASKED FOR; nothing digests what a metric MEANS. A baseline built before a metric's
    definition changed, scored against submissions computed after it, is precisely the failure
    the second paragraph describes -- identically-shaped frames, silently wrong margins -- and
    it passes this digest. FIVE live instances: #172 (three scored ``vcc2026`` members stopped
    scoring each perturbation's own target gene), #248 (the same for ``pds_*``), the
    ``direction_reach_raw`` purity floor moving from ``1 - alpha/2`` to
    ``direction.REACH_PURITY_FLOOR``, **#271** (``prep._grouped_sums`` reduces WIDE, so the
    ``bulk_lognorm`` pseudobulk itself moved for coarse-float input), and **#348**
    (``expr_mse_unbiased_capped`` gained the ``r`` factor on the prediction's correction, and
    added no config field -- verified, ``config.py`` is untouched by that commit, where its
    same-wave sibling #343 DID add ``discrimination.exclusion_scope`` and so IS caught here).
    ⚠️ #348 is benign FOR THE MEASURED OFFICIAL BASELINES, and the SCOPE is the point -- read it
    before reusing any baseline across the bump. ``metrics.delta._numerator`` gates the whole #348
    block on ``if claim > 0.0``, so a baseline whose cells are IDENTICAL within a group has
    ``jk_pred`` -- and hence ``claim`` -- at 0, the block is SKIPPED, and its
    ``expr_mse_unbiased_capped_norm`` does not move. MEASURED so on the three official #276 val
    baselines, where a pre-#348 baseline paired with a post-#348 submission therefore still yields
    correct margins.
    ⚠️ **That does NOT generalize to any baseline.** ``build_generic_baseline`` defaults to
    ``emit="dispersed"``, whose groups hold RESAMPLED, heterogeneous cells -- so ``jk_pred`` and
    ``claim`` can be POSITIVE, ``r`` can bind, and #348 CAN move such a baseline's value with
    nothing here to see it. Nor is the identical-cell zero structural:
    ``moments.jackknife_correction`` reaches it through a floating-point cancellation behind a zero
    floor and declines to promise exact equality. So a dispersed -- or any unmeasured -- baseline is
    NOT safe to reuse across #348 until its claim is measured non-binding.
    ⚠️ What makes an instance DANGEROUS is the baseline's OWN value moving. Do NOT read the
    #343/#348 pair as a rule that the dangerous ones are the caught ones: that holds for that pair
    by coincidence, and #271 immediately below is the counterexample in this very list -- it moves a
    fractional baseline's value and adds no config field either. The list is what has to be
    consulted; there is no shortcut. ⚠️ #271 is also a DIFFERENT SHAPE
    from the other four: they change what a metric MEANS, it changes the pseudobulk every
    expression/PDS member reads -- so a pre-#271 fractional baseline scored against post-#271
    submissions is the second-paragraph failure with nothing in this digest to see it. It is listed
    rather than patched for the reason the next paragraph gives, and its own constant
    (``run._GROUPED_SUM_REDUCTION_SEMANTICS``) is already carried by the other three surfaces
    (result cache, ``partition.result_semantics``, ``anchor.anchor_semantic_params``), so #314's
    registry has one more entry to absorb rather than a new idea. The third is the sharpest case for #314's shared registry:
    the floor IS a single value, so a registry entry reading it needs no per-issue constant at
    all -- ``run._result_config_digest``, ``partition.result_semantics`` and
    ``anchor.anchor_semantic_params`` each already key on the value directly, and this is the
    one surface of the four that does not.
    Deferred rather than patched (Alex, 2026-08-17) because a per-issue constant here would be
    the third copy of one idea: ``run._result_config_digest`` and ``anchor``'s
    ``anchor_semantic_params`` each already carry their own ``ontarget_exclusion_semantics``,
    and #314 proposes the shared registry all three should read instead.
    ``cell_eval2_version`` is not the fallback -- see the paragraph above, and note that #172
    lands WITHIN 0.13.0, so the stamp does not move for it at all.

    Deliberately NOT mirrored into ``run._result_config_digest``. That digest keys the RESULT
    cache, whose artifact is the per-perturbation tidy frame (``run.py``); ``agg`` is applied
    only afterwards, ``cache.config_hash`` strips ``metrics`` outright, and the resolved names
    reach the result key through the fingerprint instead. Adding ``agg`` there would buy a
    pure spurious cache miss. The two digests share policy only for inputs that move
    per-perturbation numbers, and they are never compared to each other.

def _distribution_provenance(dist: Distribution) -> str | None:
    """How an installed distribution GOT here, as one fixed token -- never its URL or path.

    ⚠️ The token is the point, not decoration. ``importlib.metadata.version`` reads
    INSTALL-TIME metadata, so an editable install reports whatever its tree declared when it
    was linked and goes on reporting it as that tree moves. MEASURED 2026-08-18: the ``-r2``
    official bundles were computed by gpudge ``3a71cc5`` (``v0.7.0-4``, four commits past the
    tag) while ``version("gpudge")`` said ``0.7.0``. A bare version string would therefore
    record a plausible FALSEHOOD in exactly our situation; ``local-editable`` beside it says
    "this is an install-time claim about a mutable tree, do not read it as a revision".

    ⚠️ NEVER RECORD THE URL OR THE PATH, only the classification. PEP 610's
    ``direct_url.json`` holds an absolute ``file://`` path into the build host's own home
    directory for the editable case, and a PRIVATE ``ssh://git@github.com/...`` URL for the VCS
    one -- and this block reaches ``baseline_meta.json`` inside every shipped bundle, so the
    path would publish an internal filesystem layout and the URL a private repository. (Neither
    literal is written out here. ``src/**`` ships, and the path in particular is a
    ``check_publish_set.SWEEP_TOKENS`` entry, so quoting it would have made this very file a
    publish blocker -- it did, in this change's first commit.) The token answers the only
    question a consumer has -- "can I trust this version string?" -- and leaks neither.
    ``test_environment_provenance.py`` asserts the absence directly, because a value that
    exists only at runtime is invisible to the publish sweeps.

    The tokens map onto PEP 610's three mutually exclusive sub-keys: no ``direct_url.json``
    -> ``release`` (resolved from an index); ``vcs_info`` -> that checkout's VCS, ``git`` in
    every case this repository has; ``dir_info`` with ``editable`` -> ``local-editable``; any
    other LOCAL source, unpacked directory or built wheel alike -> ``local``; a remote artifact
    fetched by direct URL -> ``archive``. ``archive`` is not padding: without it a direct-URL
    install would fall into ``release``, the token a reader trusts MOST, which is the one
    mislabelling that actually costs something.

    The VCS is READ rather than assumed. Answering ``git`` for a mercurial or subversion
    checkout would be a small lie of exactly the kind this whole field exists to prevent, and
    ``_VCS`` bounds the answer to PEP 610's four named systems so an unrecognised value becomes
    the generic ``vcs`` instead of an arbitrary string from a file on disk.

    ``file:`` is matched CASE-FOLDED because a URI scheme is case-insensitive (RFC 3986 3.1):
    a ``FILE:///...`` direct URL is a local install and must not be reported as a remote
    ``archive``. Only the comparison is folded -- the URL itself is never recorded.

    ⚠️ A ``direct_url.json`` that is not a JSON OBJECT (a list, a bare ``null``, a number) yields
    ``None`` -- UNCLASSIFIED -- and deliberately not ``release``, which Gemini's suggested patch
    proposed (PR #347). ``release`` means "resolved from an index", and the mere PRESENCE of this
    file is positive evidence that it was not: that is the whole basis for the ``release`` branch
    two lines up. Answering ``release`` for an unreadable payload would put the token a reader
    trusts MOST on the case we know LEAST about -- the one mislabelling this docstring already
    says actually costs something. ``None`` says "there is direct-URL provenance here and it
    could not be read", which is both true and useful.

    THE TWO HALVES ARE INDEPENDENT, and each is guarded on its own. ``dist.version`` reads

    ``**{f: baseline_meta.get(f) for f in SUBMISSION_PEERS + MANIFEST_RECORDED_ONLY}``

    IT MUST NOT CHANGE WHAT ``run`` COSTS. ``compute_metrics`` opens path inputs BACKED
    (``run.py:723-732``) and can return from a result-cache hit without ever reading ``X``
    (``run.py:816``). Materializing and content-hashing both sides for a provenance file
    would destroy both properties on the hottest path in the repo. So this reads BACKED and
    never materializes: ``fingerprint_adata`` is metadata-only unless ``cache_strict``
    (shape, dtype, var index, per-cell labels -- it deliberately never reads ``X``,
    ``cache.py:88-100``), and ``_effective_input_type`` costs at most a 500-row sample
    (``norm.py:226-245``), or nothing under v2 without ``autodetect_input_type``. The one
    exception is a cell-layout cellstream archive, which ``load_anndata`` materializes even
    with ``backed=True`` (``io.py:18-22``) -- there is no backed reader for that format, so
    this pass costs the same as the scoring read does.
    ``source_fingerprint_strict`` is recorded so the two sides never compare a metadata
    hash against a content hash.

    ⚠️ The contract above is about the MATRICES -- never materialize ``X``, never content-hash a
    side -- and the ``environment`` block does add I/O that is not of that kind: six
    ``importlib.metadata`` distribution lookups, each reading at most ``METADATA`` and
    ``direct_url.json``. MEASURED on the reference venv 2026-08-19: **7.2 ms** for the whole
    block, ~0.8 ms per distribution, once per call -- and this function is called exactly once
    per run (``cli.py:542``) and once per bundle leg (``real_bundle.py:226``), never inside a
    per-perturbation loop. Against the two backed h5ad opens and the up-to-500-row
    ``_effective_input_type`` sample this same function already performs, that is noise. It is
    written down rather than left to be discovered, because "must not change what ``run``
    costs" read literally forbids any new I/O at all (Codex, checkpoint 2), and the exemption
    is deliberate and bounded rather than an oversight.

    Returns the dict; the CALLER writes it only after the aggregate it describes has been
    written successfully. Publishing first would leave new metadata beside a STALE
    ``agg_results.csv`` in a reused output directory when the run then fails, and ``score``
