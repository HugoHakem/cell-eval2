    ⚠️ The flag is the one DIGEST-EXEMPT bypass of the guard stopping a log1p submission under the
    frozen ``vcc2026`` rule (``validate_input=False`` disables it too, but that field is *not*
    exempt, so a pairing check can see it), and it is in ``baseline.DIGEST_EXEMPT_FIELDS`` -- so ``config_digest``,
    the field ``score``'s baseline/submission pairing check compares, CANNOT SEE IT. Measured on
    ``docs/data/H1-VCC-2025-training.h5ad``: the same log1p submission scored as counts moves every
    scored member (``sig_jaccard`` 0.811 -> 0.003, ``lfc_nmae`` 0.170 -> 1.927, ``pds_cosine``
    1.000 -> 0.450) with a BYTE-IDENTICAL ``config_digest``. The harm is self-inflicted -- every
    member gets worse, so it is a scoring-integrity gap and not an exploit -- but it was silent.

    RULED (2026-08-17, Alex): warn; keep the exemption. Removing the flag from
    ``DIGEST_EXEMPT_FIELDS`` would break EVERY baseline/submission pairing, because both baseline
    producers (``baseline.baseline_config``, ``real_bundle._baseline_leg``) flip it True on an
    internal copy and rely on the exemption so the artifact still pairs. The clean fix -- digest the
    REQUESTED config, as ``build_generic_baseline`` already does for ``allow_discrete`` -- moves
    ``config_digest`` and so invalidates existing baselines: a release decision, in files this chunk
    does not own.

    Fires only when the allowance was LOAD-BEARING, i.e. this matrix is fractional and
    ``validate_input_type`` would otherwise have raised. An inert flag says nothing, which is what
    keeps this from becoming a line people learn to ignore. ``_is_all_integer`` is the validator's
    OWN predicate (the same one ``validate_input_type``'s ``input_type == "counts"`` branch tests)
    rather than an equivalent of mine, deliberately: the warning must fire exactly when the raise
    would have, and a re-implementation could drift from it.

    Three scope limits, all real. The flag is pred-side only (``_val_allow_fractional``), so a True
    value here IS the pred side. Every caller gates on ``validate_input and version != "v1"``, so
    this is silent for ``validate_input=False`` and on v1 -- where nothing is validated at all, a
    wider hole that a warning on this path would not describe. And it cannot fire when the matrix is
    never classified: a BACKED (path) input skips the up-front validation loop, and a result-cache
    hit returns before the deferred sites run, so a warm run on path inputs reaches neither. Forcing
    a classification there would make a cache hit read ``X``, which is the one cost the results
    cache exists to avoid -- so that case gets the cheaper, scan-free
    ``_warn_fractional_allowance_unclassified`` instead (codex-review round 8, P1).

    ``target_sum=1e6`` the two sides sit **14.9x-25.2x apart**, median 18.4x. ``target_sum=None``
    resolves to the reference control pool's median and removes the bulk of it -- 0.82x-1.37x,
    median 1.00x -- but not exactly, because the submission is not normalized to one constant.

    The distortion is NOT a constant additive offset in log1p space: it is
    ``log1p(T*f) - log1p(S_c*f)``, gene-dependent and vanishing at zero expression. So it

    most of the profile while the error metrics are meaningless.

    statistic, so the two halves of this docstring disagreed. As of #231 "mean" would in
    fact be accurate for the SHIPPED catalog -- but this function implements the published
    generic format, not the current catalog, so it keeps describing the field it reads.

    ``drop_nans()`` before the statistic so one degenerate perturbation (e.g. a
    single-class AUC pert emitting NaN, metrics/de.py:296,301) cannot null out
    the whole metric's aggregate. Matches the reference's NaN-skipping
    ``.describe()`` semantics and the compat path. Per-pert NaN values are left
    untouched in the tidy frame; only the aggregate skips them. An all-NaN
    metric aggregates to NaN (not null) via ``fill_null`` so downstream
    arithmetic (e.g. ``compat.score_agg_metrics``) is unaffected, matching the
    reference ``.describe()`` (an all-NaN column's mean is NaN).

    The statistic is per-metric (``MetricSpec.agg``). Since #231 EVERY shipped entry

    published -- it is kept because the statistic is meant to stay a catalog edit rather
    than a source edit, and it stays exercised by
    ``test_metric_aggregation.py::test_median_agg_is_honoured_by_both_aggregators``, which
    injects ``agg="median"`` onto a metric and asserts THIS function returns the median.
    (``test_the_median_row_is_unconditional_not_a_second_agg_lookup`` covers the wide
    aggregator's separate branch, not this one.) The output column keeps the name ``mean``
    whatever the statistic -- renaming it would break compat, score.py and every published
    artifact -- and the ``agg`` column records which statistic each row actually holds.
    ``aggregate_metrics_wide`` additionally publishes a ``median`` row for every metric, so
    the statistic a metric does not score on is still readable.

    When ``metrics`` is supplied, it is the resolved selection behind ``df``. Derived rows

    ⚠️ This is NOT the wide frame's ``count`` row, and #239 is the reason the distinction
    matters. ``count``/``null_count`` describe the RAW series on purpose ("their job is to
    report what was there"), and polars nulls are not NaNs -- so a metric that returns NaN for
    a perturbation it could not score reports ``count = N`` and ``null_count = 0`` while the
    statistic averaged fewer than N values. MEASURED on the public VCC 2025 training data
    (docs/data/H1-VCC-2025-training.h5ad, half-data arm, vcc2026 preset): the two mechanisms
    split cleanly, and only one of them is already visible.

      over 2. #239 names ``direction_reach`` explicitly as having the same problem, and for
      this class the cohort was NOT recoverable from the aggregate at all.

    A derived metric (``agg="ratio_of_sums"``) has no per-perturbation rows by construction, so
    its counts are all 0 and ``derived`` is true -- 0 there means "not applicable", not "nothing
    scored". Flagged rather than omitted so the sidecar's metric set still matches the wide
    frame's columns.

    NOT included: the per-perturbation OMISSION REASONS #239 also asks for ("ideally"). They are
    logged by the metric implementations in ``metrics/de.py``, and capturing them means changing

    comparator, and under v1 a metric CAN emit nothing (the no-droppable-NaN fill is
    version-gated at run.py:207-211). An observed-but-unexpected metric is kept rather
    than dropped: that combination is a caller bug, and silent data loss is the worse
    failure. An empty column set RAISES -- a statistic-only frame scores to a vacuous
    ``avg_score = 0.0``, which reads as a real result.

    Every statistic is computed on the NaN-DROPPED series, matching ``aggregate_metrics``
    (issue #92 / PR #52) and NOT ``DataFrame.describe()``, which propagates NaN. The
    difference is not cosmetic: a NaN aggregate is a degenerate baseline, and one
    degenerate perturbation would otherwise decide the whole column. ``score_metrics`` now
    refuses such a baseline for every DECISIVE metric (spec 6; ``catalog.is_decisive``), now
    including every ``vcc2026`` member, and drops any other scored one from ``avg_score``,
    rather than -- as it used to for the anchor-1 class -- silently scoring
    every submission 0 on that metric with no
    error raised. ``count`` and ``null_count`` describe the RAW series, since their job is
    to report what was there.

    An undefined statistic is NaN, never a stand-in value. That includes ``std``: polars
    ``.std()`` is the SAMPLE std, undefined for a single observation and for an empty
    series alike, and reporting ``0.0`` for either is a false claim of zero spread that
    ``comparison_statistic="std"`` would consume as fact.
